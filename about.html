    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Northville4Bees is a community-driven organization dedicated to supporting pollinators and building a healthier environment for future generations within our community. 
    Founded by local highschool students passionate about conservation, our mission is simple: empower Northville residents to make a real difference — one seed, one garden, and one bee at a time.</p>

    <p>Through educational outreach, eco-friendly products, and community events, we’re helping transform ordinary backyards, schools, and parks into thriving habitats where pollinators can flourish.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>At Northville4Bees, we believe small actions create big change. Our mission is to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Raise awareness about the critical role of bees and pollinators</li>
        <li>Provide easy, affordable ways for people to create bee-friendly gardens</li>
        <li>Strengthen the Northville community through shared environmental action</li>
    </ul>

<!-- <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Seed Kits and Starter Gardens: Affordable seed packets curated to attract and support pollinators.</li>
        <li>DIY Bee Houses: Simple projects for creating lasting habitats in your own backyard.</li>
        <li>Community Events: Seed giveaways, educational workshops, and outreach stands at local markets.</li>
        <li>Education: Teaching families, schools, and neighborhoods how to support biodiversity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Everything we offer is designed to be easy, fun, and impactful — whether you have a big yard, a small patio, or just a sunny windowsill.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Northville4Bees was founded in 2025 by three students — Moritz, Caleb, and Ayan — who saw a need for real, local action to protect pollinators.
    Starting as a small club project, our movement grew from a simple idea into a mission to make Northville a leading example of a pollinator-friendly community.
    Today, we're proud to work with local families, businesses, schools, and volunteers who share our vision for a greener, healthier world.</p>

<!--   <h2>Why Pollinators Matter</h2>
    <p>Bees and other pollinators are essential to the environment and the food supply — yet their populations are under threat.
    By creating safe spaces filled with native plants, water sources, and shelter, we can help reverse this trend and protect these critical species for generations to come.</p>
-->
    <h2>Join Us</h2>
